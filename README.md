# beatfever-legacy
BeatFever Mania is an rhythm action game for the Raspberry Pi, based on [osu!](http://osu.ppy.sh/)'s "Catch the Beat" mode. We developed this project for our university's faire, [FETIN](http://www.inatel.br/fetin/). We had no experience on either Python or Raspberry Pi development, so we had to learn a lot 

## Libraries required:
- [Pi3d](https://github.com/tipam/pi3d)
- [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/)
- Pillow
- Python 2.7

You can install all of the libraries with the pip package manager:
`pip install pygame pi3d pillow`
